            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px; max-width: 700px;">The journey of Qman began in 1994, sparked by Mr. Zhan
                Kehua's realization
                of his children's deep love for building blocks. This passion inspired the creation of an original
                Chinese brand focused on building blocks.</p>

                committed to the brand philosophy that "<b>Qman blocks make dreams come true</b>" and together with our

            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">LEGO, a globally iconic toy brand, is celebrated for its interlocking
                plastic bricks that spark
                creativity and imagination. Founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Christiansen in Denmark, LEGO began as a wooden
                toy manufacturer before evolving into the plastic brick system we know today in 1958.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                LEGO sets come in various themes, including <b>LEGO City, Ninjago, Nexo Knight, Chima</b>, and licensed
                series
                like <b>Harry Potter, Despicable Me 4</b>. Beyond physical toys, LEGO has expanded into video games,
                movies
                (The LEGO Movie), and digital apps, offering endless creative opportunities for both children and
                adults.
