            <h2>Qman</h2>
            <p><strong>A leading Chinese toy brand, specializing in original building blocks since 1994.</strong></p>
            <p>The journey of Qman began in 1994, sparked by Mr. Zhan Kehua's realization of his children's deep love
                for building blocks. This passion inspired the creation of an original Chinese brand focused on building
                blocks.</p>
            <p>Today, Qman has evolved into more than just a children's toy brand—it is a celebrated national brand that
                has grown alongside multiple generations. We are committed to the brand philosophy that "Qman blocks
                make dreams come true," and together with our customers, we use small building pieces to bring dreams to
                life.</p>
